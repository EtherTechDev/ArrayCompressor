# ArrayCompressor
A JavaScript module written in ES6, which quickly and effectively, with a small footprint, compress Arrays with integer data.
Return value is either a JavaScript Array or a B64 string.

Uses a combination of RLE and Huffman Encoding to achieve well-compressed output.

Typical use cases for this library are:
1. Compression of large arrays of alpha values for images
2. Compression of large arrays of Graph data
3. Compression of large arrays of any number of the same values in groups which benefits from RLE (run-length encoding).

Example:
input:
let dataToCompress = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 255, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 255, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 32, 32, 255, 255, 255, 32, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 255, 255, 0, 255, 255, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 255, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 255, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 255, 255, 255, 32, 255, 255, 255, 255, 32,0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 255, 255, 0, 255, 255, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64, 64,  128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128];

result:
> Compression ratio: 26.37% of original size.

TODO:
1. Add checks for errors
2. Add test cases
3. Add example scripts for usage
4. Remove debug printouts
